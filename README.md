## Get Started

To start development you need to:

```batch
npm i
npm start
```

This will start a watcher for changes of the code.

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## npm releases

For a new **patch release**, execute on the machine where you're logged into your npm account:

```bash
npm run release
```

In case you have 2FA setup on npm.js, pass a code as One Time Password:

```bash
npm run release --otp <yourcode>
```

Command is powered by [`release-it`](https://github.com/webpro/release-it) package, defined in the `package.json`.

That's what the command does without any user interaction:

- create release commit by updating version in `package.json`
- create tag for that release commit
- push commit & tag
- create a new release on GitHub, with change log auto-generated from commit messages
- publish to npm as a new release

If you want to create a **minor** or **major release**, use these commands:

```bash
npm run release-minor
```

```bash
npm run release-major
```
